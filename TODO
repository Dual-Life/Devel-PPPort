These would be nice for 3.00:

* Update the HACKERS doc (and probably other docs as well)

* Well, no bugz would be nice ;-)


These would always be nice:

* more documentation, more tests

* more examples in parts/inc/pod

* Resolve dependencies in Makefile.PL and remind of running 'make regen'


Mmmhhh, don't know what to do about these:

* pad_findmy??
