These would be nice for 3.00:

* make sure functions that are dependencies don't trigger hints (TEST)

* Replace all Perl_ that _don't_ have ... non-Perl_ macro (TEST)

* add more hints

* update documentation in ppport.h

* check for TODO's

* use Text::Diff and File::Temp ?

* README

* DOCs

* document devel/ tools

* More tests (as always)

* more documentation


Mmmhhh, don't know what to do about these:

* pad_findmy??

* Don't need to install the harness files - fix Makefile.PL


These things should also have tests:
